          -display display_name
                  Drop the snowflakes on the given display. Make sure
                  the display is nearby, so you can hear them enjoy...

          -snowflakes num_snowflakes
                  This is the number of snowflakes. Default is 100,
                  max is 1000.

          -sc snowflake_color
                  Use the given string as the color for the flakes
                  instead of the default "snow".

          -bg background_color
                  Use the given string as the color for the
                  background. Note that the usual default desktop
                  pattern consisting of 50% white 50% black doesn't
                  particularly look good with Xsnow.

          -tc tree_color
                  Use the given string as the color for the trees.

          -slc sleigh_color
                  Use the given string as the color for the sleigh.
                  Note that the default color is black, so not much of
                  Santa will be seen on a black background.

          -santa santa_size
                  There are 3 sizes of Santa: 0, 1 and 2. Default is
                  1.

          -santaspeed santa_speed
                  The speed Santa should not exceed if he doesn't want
                  to get fined. The default speed for Santa size 0 is
                  1, for Santa 1 it's 2 and for Big Santa it's 4.

          -delay delay
                  This is the number of milliseconds delay after
                  updating everything.  Default is 50 milliseconds,
                  i.e. 20 updates per second max.

          -unsmooth
                  If you specify this option the snowflakes will

                  'whirl' more dramatically, resulting in a somewhat
                  jerkier movement.

          -whirl  This sets the whirl factor, i.e. the maximum
                  adjustment of the horizontal speed. The default
                  value is 4.

          -nowind Default it gets windy now and then. If you prefer it
                  quiet specify -nowind.

          -windtimer period
                  With -windtimer you can specify how often it gets
                  windy. It's sort of a period in seconds, default
                  value is 30.

          -xspeed -yspeed
                  These options set the maximum horizontal and
                  vertical speed. The default X maximum speed is 4,
                  the default maximum Y speed is 8.

          -wsnowdepth -ssnowdepth
                  This sets the maximum thickness of the snow on top
                  of windows and at the bottom of the display
                  respectively. The default snowdepth for windows is
                  8, at the bottom of the screen the default is 50.

          -notrees
                  Do not display the trees.

          -nosanta
                  Do not display Santa Claus running all over the
                  screen.

          -norudolf
                  No Rudolf.

          -nokeepsnow
                  Do not have snow sticking anywhere.

          -nokeepsnowonwindows
                  Do not keep snow on top of the windows.

          -nokeepsnowonscreen
                  Do not keep snow at the bottom of the screen.

          -version
                  Prints the current Xsnow version.

          xsnow -bg LightSkyBlue3 -sc snow
                  Sets the background to a bluish color and lets it
                  snow white.

          xsnow -ssnowdepth 100
                  Starts with a thin layer of snow that gradually
                  builds up at the bottom of the screen.

          xsnow -santa 2 -santaspeed 10
                  Gives you the biggest Santa at a speed that is
                  hardly legal.

          xsnow -delay 100 -notrees
                  For slow systems use longer delay and don't draw the
                  trees.

          xsnow -snowflakes 1000 -delay 0
                  Uses the maximum number of snowflakes and runs as
                  fast as possible.

          Xsnow itself doen't use very much CPU time, but it can load
          the X server and/or network quite substantially. Use less
          snowflakes and a bigger delay in such a case. On a
          standalone workstation there usually will not be be any
          problem.
